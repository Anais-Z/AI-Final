# AI-Final

The goal of this project was to use the necessary attributes found in a provided dataset and create a classification module for the red vine dataset. With PyCaret, I was able to create a supervised machine learning regression module. In this case. For my dataset, the target value was quality. When comparing all models using the compare_models function, I was able to find out that Random Forest, Extra Tree and Light Gradient Boosting Machine gave me the best performances. I then decided to analyse more and found out that the Light Gradient Boosting Machine gave me the best performance in terms of predicting the value of quality with a score of 0.69.
